# This script helps you check if your Raspberry pi is correctly powered.
# You can read more about Raspberry pi powering issues here: https://ownyourbits.com/2019/02/02/whats-wrong-with-the-raspberry-pi/


# If you're pi is correctly powered (stable power supply and quality cable), after running the script, you should get something like:
#
# 45.6'C 1400 / 600 MHz 1.3813V -
# 55.3'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3813V -
# 58.0'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3813V -
# 60.2'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3813V -
# 60.2'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3813V -
# 61.1'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3813V -
# 61.1'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3813V -
# 60.8'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3813V -

# If your power supply can't provide a stable 5V 2.5A or if the cable is not good enough, you should get something like:
#
# 39.7'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3875V - Throttling has occurred, Under-voltage has occurred,
# 48.3'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3875V - Throttling has occurred, Under-voltage has occurred,
# 52.1'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3875V - Throttling has occurred, Under-voltage has occurred,
# 54.8'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3875V - Throttling has occurred, Under-voltage has occurred,

# 56.4'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3875V - Throttling has occurred, Under-voltage has occurred,
# 57.5'C 1400 / 1400 MHz 1.3875V - Throttling has occurred, Under-voltage has occurred,
